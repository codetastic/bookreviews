                    The bomb detonated on Saturday in New York, and a device found nearby, were both shrapnel-filled pressure cookers - similar to the bombs used at the 2013 Boston marathon, US media report. Citing officials, separate reports said both had mobile phones
                    and Christmas lights as makeshift detonators The blast, in the Chelsea area of Manhattan, injured 29 people. The FBI said it stopped a "vehicle of interest" in Brooklyn on Sunday but made no arrests. Five people were taken into custody
                    for questioning, officials told US media. But a spokeswoman said no-one had been charged and the investigation was continuing. The Manhattan blast followed a pipe bomb explosion on the route of a charity race in New Jersey on Sunday.
